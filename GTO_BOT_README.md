# GTO Poker Bot Implementation

This document describes the implementation of a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Poker Bot using Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) algorithm.

## Overview

The GTO Poker Bot is designed to learn optimal poker strategies through iterative self-play using the CFR algorithm. It integrates seamlessly with your existing poker engine without modifying any existing code.

## Quick Start

### Running the Demo
The easiest way to see the GTO Bot in action is to run the main demo:

**In IntelliJ:**
1. Open `src/main/java/Main.java`
2. Right-click and select "Run 'Main.main()'" or click the green play button

**From Terminal:**
```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"
```

This will run a demonstration showing the GTO Bot playing against different opponents (Random, Rule-Based, and Check-Call bots).

## Key Components

### 1. GTOPokerBot.java
The main bot class that implements the `PlayerStrategy` interface. This bot uses CFR to make decisions based on learned strategies.

**Key Features:**
- Implements CFR algorithm for strategy learning
- Integrates with existing poker game flow
- Supports both training and playing modes
- Provides strategy analysis capabilities

**Usage:**
```java
GTOPokerBot gtoBot = new GTOPokerBot();

// Train the bot (optional - can be used untrained)
gtoBot.train(10000); // Train for 10,000 iterations

// Use in a poker game
Player player = new Player(Position.SMALL_BLIND, 1000);
player.setStrategy(gtoBot);
```

### 2. CFRAlgorithm.java
Implements the core Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithm.

**Key Features:**
- Regret calculation and strategy updates
- Information set management
- Hand strength evaluation
- Exploration vs exploitation balance

### 3. CFRGameTree.java
Manages the game tree representation for CFR calculations.

**Key Features:**
- Information set storage and retrieval
- Action availability management
- Strategy and regret tracking
- Game state representation

### 4. CFRTrainingManager.java
Handles the training process for CFR-based bots.

**Key Features:**
- Self-play training sessions
- Training statistics tracking
- Bot performance evaluation
- Strategy convergence monitoring

### 5. GTOBotDemo.java
Demonstration class showing how to use the GTO bot.

**Key Features:**
- Bot training examples
- Decision making demonstrations
- Strategy analysis
- Performance comparisons

## How CFR Works

### 1. Information Sets
The bot groups similar game states into "information sets" based on:
- Hole cards (sorted for consistency)
- Board cards
- Current street (preflop, flop, turn, river)
- Pot size categories
- Betting situation

### 2. Regret Calculation
For each information set, the bot calculates:
- **Regret**: How much better each action would have been
- **Strategy**: Probability distribution over available actions
- **Counterfactual Utility**: Expected value of each action

### 3. Strategy Updates
The bot updates its strategy using regret matching:
- Actions with positive regret get higher probability
- Actions with negative regret get lower probability
- Over time, this converges to an optimal strategy

### 4. Training Process
1. Generate random game scenarios
2. Calculate utilities for each action
3. Update regrets based on outcomes
4. Update strategy using regret matching
5. Repeat for many iterations

## Integration with Existing Code

The GTO bot integrates seamlessly with your existing poker engine:

```java
// In your main method
Player gtoPlayer = new Player(Position.SMALL_BLIND, 1000);
Player randomPlayer = new Player(Position.BIG_BLIND, 1000);
PokerSession pokerSession = new PokerSession(5, 10, gtoPlayer, randomPlayer);

// Create and train GTO bot
GTOPokerBot gtoBot = new GTOPokerBot();
gtoBot.train(1000);

// Assign strategies
gtoPlayer.setStrategy(gtoBot);
randomPlayer.setStrategy(new RandomRaiseBot());

// Run games
pokerSession.runNumberOfGamesAutoRebuy(10);
```

## Training Parameters

### CFR Algorithm Parameters
- **Training Iterations**: 10,000 (default)
- **Exploration Probability**: 0.6
- **Exploration Decay**: 0.999
- **Hand Strength Weight**: 0.3
- **Action Quality Weight**: 0.7

### Bet Sizing
- **Bet Size**: 50% of pot
- **Raise Size**: 75% of pot
- **Minimum Raise**: Big blind amount

## Performance Characteristics

### Training Time
- **Quick Training**: 1,000 iterations (~1-2 minutes)
- **Standard Training**: 10,000 iterations (~10-15 minutes)
- **Deep Training**: 50,000 iterations (~1-2 hours)

### Memory Usage
- Scales with number of unique information sets
- Typical usage: 10-100 MB for standard training
- Information sets grow with training complexity

### Convergence
- Strategy converges to Nash equilibrium over time
- Early iterations show rapid improvement
- Later iterations provide fine-tuning

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```java
// Create a GTO bot
GTOPokerBot bot = new GTOPokerBot();

// Train the bot (optional)
bot.train(5000);

// Use in a game
Player player = new Player(Position.SMALL_BLIND, 1000);
player.setStrategy(bot);
```

### Advanced Training
```java
// Create a training manager
CFRTrainingManager manager = new CFRTrainingManager();

// Run advanced training
manager.runTrainingSession(10000);

// Get trained bots
GTOPokerBot trainedBot1 = manager.getBot1();
GTOPokerBot trainedBot2 = manager.getBot2();
```

### Running the Demo
The easiest way to see the GTO Bot in action is to run the included demo:

```java
// The Main.java file contains a complete demonstration
// Just run it to see GTO Bot vs different opponents
```

### Strategy Analysis
```java
// Get learned strategies
Map<String, double[]> strategies = bot.getStrategyMap();

// Analyze specific information set
String infoSet = "P0_AASPAHE_B_FLOP_M_C";
double[] strategy = strategies.get(infoSet);
// strategy[0] = fold probability
// strategy[1] = call probability
// strategy[2] = bet probability
```

## Comparison with Other Bots

| Bot Type | Strategy | Learning | Performance |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| RandomRaiseBot | Random | None | Low |
| RuleBasedBot | Heuristic | None | Medium |
| SimpleCheckCallBot | Passive | None | Low |
| **GTOPokerBot** | **CFR-based** | **Self-play** | **High** |

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Monte Carlo CFR**: More efficient sampling
2. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning integration
3. **Real-time Learning**: Online strategy updates
4. **Multi-player Support**: 6-max and 9-max games
5. **Advanced Bet Sizing**: Dynamic sizing based on board texture

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Database Storage**: Persist learned strategies
2. **Web Interface**: Real-time bot performance monitoring
3. **API Integration**: Connect with online poker platforms
4. **Tournament Support**: Multi-table tournament play

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Slow Training**: Reduce iteration count or complexity
2. **Memory Issues**: Clear strategy cache periodically
3. **Poor Performance**: Increase training iterations
4. **Compilation Errors**: Check Suit enum values (CLUB, DIAMOND, SPADE, HEART)
5. **Runtime Errors**: Make sure to use `player.setStrategy(bot)` not `player.strategy = bot`

### Performance Tips
1. Start with fewer iterations for testing
2. Use training manager for advanced scenarios
3. Monitor information set count during training
4. Reset bot between different training sessions
5. The bot works even without training (uses default strategies)

### Running the Program
- **IntelliJ**: Right-click `Main.java` → "Run 'Main.main()'"
- **Terminal**: `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"`
- **Maven**: `mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"`
